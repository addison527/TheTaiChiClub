NAVBAR SECTION:  Vicky if you could try to figure this out this would be great. I WILL ALSO WORK ON

1. IN MOBILE: when hovering over anywhere but the submenu (info and about submenus), the submenu should close
    WORD CLARITY: menu = home, about, info, contact
                submenu = about drop down menu with about merch philosophy
                submenu = information drop dow menu with demo, schedule, follow along
2. When click on the â˜° button it should open and when you no longer hover over the button or the menu, it should close. Currently it only closes if you click it again.

3. IN MOBILE the submenu should also open to the LEFT in mobile not to the right, currently its out of frame when I open

4. IN MOBILE the home and contact buttons should be formatted like the about and information buttons in the drop down
--------------
ABOUT page (addison)
1. top half the picture dissapears under the navbar in mobile: make sure it keeps its position

BLOGS/philosophy page (addison)(THEY ARE THE SAME, PHILOSOPHY PAGE HAS THE BLOGS LINK)
1. do it.

HEROSECTION (addison)
1. clean it
2. insert picture for the hero section

MERCH page (addison)
1. make it

DEMO + FOLLOW ALONG PAGE (addison and vicky)
1. fix mobile view
2. when clicking on the cards (in the home page) it should take you to the top of the page NOT the middle
3. when clicking on the buttons in the navbar , it should also take you to the top of the page, I believe only the follow along button in the navbar takes u to the top
4. dynamic sizing for mobile and smaller applications like ipad

ALL (addison and vicky)
1. make sure all the pages CAN BE ACCESSIBLE IN MOBILE!!
2. and when the content is short, make sure footer can be seen: sometimes even if the content doesnt even take up a whole page, you still have to scroll to see the footer due to spacing issues. Solve by at the top of all the pages IF and ONLY IF the page uses <FullScreen> attribute , INSERT footerheight={80} at the FullScreen div <>

PUBLISHING 
1. make sure images transfer when live
2. watch the video to publish
3. publish website using git (possible sizing issue)


NOTES: to make dynamic : refer to my contact & class schedule page: 
either create a variable for whether the application is mbile or not by using window.innerwidth OR use vw and vh to edit the width and height of items (such as cards) to fit RELATIVE to the screen.
