NAVBAR SECTION:  (MOST IMPORTANT:  PLS LOOK AT THIS VICKY) (addison & vicky)
1. IN MOBILE: when hovering over anywhere but the submenu (info and about submenus), the submenu should close
    WORD CLARITY: menu = home, about, info, contact
                submenu = 'About' drop down menu with about merch philosophy
                submenu = 'Informatio'n drop down menu with demo, schedule, follow along
2. IN MOBILE When click on the â˜° button it should open and when you no longer hover over the button or the menu, it should close. Currently it only closes if you click it again.

3. IN MOBILE the submenus of the menu should also open to the LEFT (better visibility) in mobile not to the right, currently its out of frame/on top of the menu when I open, and should also automatically close when the mouse stops hovering over it. also I think the z index is too low for the submenus in mobile.

4. IN MOBILE when hovering over the submenu options, it should change to the dark blue. In desktop, it works, but doesnt work in mobile. 

5. When no longer hovering over a submenu, it should close. Currently it stays open.

6. IN MOBILE the home and contact buttons should be formatted like the about and information buttons in the drop down. Right now, they are not centered and the border bottom does not right across the entire 150px

FOR VICKY: 
NOTES: to make dynamic : refer to my contact & class schedule page: 
either create a variable for whether the application is mbile or not by using window.innerwidth OR use vw and vh to edit the width and height of items (such as cards) to fit RELATIVE to the screen.
